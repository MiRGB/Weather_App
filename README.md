A simple and functional weather application that can be launched directly in the browser. It utilizes the **WeatherAPI.com** service to fetch real-time weather data based on user input.

## 🌍 How It Works

1. The user enters the name of a city.
2. The app fetches current weather data using the [weatherapi.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/) API.
3. It then displays:
   - 🌡 Current temperature
   - 🌥 Weather description (e.g. sunny, cloudy)
   - 💨 Wind speed
   - 💧 Humidity
   - ⏱ Local time in the selected location

## 🧩 Features

- 📡 Real-time weather data  
- 🌐 Displays both weather and local time  
- 📱 Responsive design  
- ⚠️ Handles invalid or misspelled city names

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript (Vanilla)  
- [weatherapi.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/) (REST API)

## 📂 Getting Started

To run the application locally:

1. Clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/MiRGB/weather-app.git`

2. Navigate to the project folder:

`cd weather-app`

3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

✅ No additional setup or installation is required.

📌 Note
To use the weather data, the application relies on a free API key from [weatherapi.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/). The demo version is already configured with a sample key, but if you're cloning the project and want to use your own, update the key in the JavaScript file.
